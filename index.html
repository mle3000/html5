      <h2>Watermelon</h2>
      <p>is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.

Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or as an ingredient in mixed beverages</p>

      <h3>Why I chose the watermelon color palatte</h3>
      <p>Watermelon colors look great together. The bright green and hot pink always grab my attention immediately. These colors remind me of buying watermelon flavored bubbalicious gum as a kid. When I went to Chania, Greece they had a real obsession with watermelons and you would always see trucks of watermelons and depictions all over the place. When my brother was about six years old he swallowed his watermelon gum and threw it up all over my moms persian rug. Right before he did it he exclaimed "I smell pumpkins!". We still tease him about that to this day.  </p>
