      <h2>Is a Cucumber a Melon?</h2>
      <p>It is a common misconception that a cucumber is a melon. While cucumbers and melons are in the same family <i>cucurbitoideae</i> they are not the same species</p><p> Cucumbers belong to the family <i>Cucumis Sativus</i>, Musk Melons (like cantaloupe) belong to the family <i>Cucumis Melo</i> and watermelon is a <i>citrullus</i>, which is a different branch of the same family. Melons and cucumbers do require a lot of the same growing conditions.

        <h3>Cucumber Varietals</h3>
        <p>There are many different varieties of cucumbers. The three main cultivars are:
          <dl><dt>Slicing</dt>
          <dd>
Cucumbers grown to eat fresh are called slicing cucumbers. The main varieties of slicers mature on vines with large leaves that provide shading.

Slicers grown commercially for the North American market are generally longer, smoother, more uniform in color, and have much tougher skin. In contrast, those in other countries, often called European cucumbers, are smaller and have thinner, more delicate skin, often with fewer seeds, thus are often being sold in plastic skin for protection. This variety may also be called a telegraph cucumber, particularly in Australasia. </dd>
<dt>Pickling</dt><dd>Pickling with brine, sugar, vinegar, and spices creates various flavored products from cucumbers and other foods.[12] Although any cucumber can be pickled, commercial pickles are made from cucumbers specially bred for uniformity of length-to-diameter ratio and lack of voids in the flesh. Those cucumbers intended for pickling, called picklers, grow to about 7 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) wide. Compared to slicers, picklers tend to be shorter, thicker, less-regularly shaped, and have bumpy skin with tiny white or black-dotted spines. Color can vary from creamy yellow to pale or dark green.</dd>
<dd>a sub category of pickling is gherkin which are smaller in size</dd>

<dt>Burpless</dt><dd>
Burpless cucumbers are sweeter and have a thinner skin than other varieties of cucumber. They are reputed to be easy to digest and to have a pleasant taste. They can grow as long as 60 centimeters (2 ft), are nearly seedless, and have a delicate skin. Most commonly grown in greenhouses, these parthenocarpic cucumbers are often found in grocery markets, shrink-wrapped in plastic. They are marketed as either burpless or seedless, as the seeds and skin of other varieties of cucumbers are said to give some people gas.</dd>

      <h3>The Cucumber palatte</h3>
      <p>I thought the lush green cucumber palatte would be a good palatte cleanser. Much like the cucumber itself, it provides a refreshing treat you can place upon your eyes. Green is a great color. Green is the color of money. Green is the color for "go" in a stoplight. Green is used for nightvision because the human eye is most sensitive to that color. Green is also used to represent sickness in cartoons.
