      <h2>Cantaloupe</h2>
      <p>The cantaloupe, rockmelon (Australia and New Zealand, although cantaloupe is used in some states of Australia), sweet melon, or spanspek (Southern Africa) is a melon that is a variety of the muskmelon species (Cucumis melo) from the family Cucurbitaceae.

Cantaloupes range in weight from 0.5 to 5 kilograms (1 to 11 lb). Originally, cantaloupe referred only to the non-netted, orange-fleshed melons of Europe, but today may refer to any orange-fleshed melon of the C. melo species</p>

      <h3>The Cantaloupe palatte:</h3>
      <p>While I love the color palatte of watermelon. I wanted to showcase some of the other beautiful palattes derived from melons. I also really can't choose which melon is the best. All melons are very tasty. I subscribe to a seasonal farm box and in the summer we get a melon every week. When I was pregnant with my son the season of melons coincided with the worst period of morning sickness the smell of melons made me want to vomit. I am so glad to have moved past that and this year I am looking forward to enjoying my melons. Iced blended cantaloupe drink is a particularly wonderful way to enjoy an excess of this fruit. I can't wait to share this treat with my son!</p>
